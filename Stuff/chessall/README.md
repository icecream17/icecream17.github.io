# Chessall

I'm writing this for easi*er* use.

Instead of figuring out how to use chess.js and chessboard.js can you simply use this!

There are css classes and ids so you can customize it.

## How to use

Simply put this code in your html.
```HTML
<script src = "https://icecream17.github.io/Stuff/chessall/chessall.js"></script>
``` 

Optionally, but nice, you can also put this:
```HTML
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "https://icecream17.github.io/Stuff/chessall/chessall.css">
``` 

## Want to edit it?

If you want to create your own version, but want to put it *here*, you can make your own css and/or js code.
Make a pull request with your files.

They will be hosted under https://icecream17.github.io/Stuff/chessall/versions/username.js and
