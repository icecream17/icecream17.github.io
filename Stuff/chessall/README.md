# Chessall

I'm writing this for easi*er* use.

Instead of figuring out how to use chess.js and chessboard.js can you simply use this!

There are css classes and ids so you can customize it.

Simply put this code in your html.
```HTML
<script src = "https://icecream17.github.io/Stuff/chessall/chessall.js"></script>
```
