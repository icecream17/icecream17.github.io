# Security Policy

Lol this code isn't gonna handle any passwords or stuff like that. It's... probably fine.

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Simply go to "Issues" and explain the vulnerability

I'm kinda new

> Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

> *Github Auto-Security file maker*

Give resources and assume I didn't know anything about it (because I don't) so I can understand, learn and stuff

I'll respond in a randomish time, because this is a hobby thing (kinda).

## Status / Response Codes
