               I've tried to make everything tabbable.<br>
               Note that the menu has a 1 second delay.
            </p>
            <p>
               Well actually the menu updates every 77 milliseconds.<br>
               I set it so that the menu waits 13 updates until it closes.<br>
               That just happens to be 1.001 seconds, but you can change it here:<br>(Not done yet)

               Currently contrast is high. You can change the colors here:
