The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all

The part of this license that is preceded by and followed by 37 hyphen-minuses
are not a condition of this license but rather clarifications, and any part of
this license following (the clarfications and both sets of 37 hyphen-minuses)
are not clarifications but conditions unless otherwise stated.

-------------------------------------
A newline is a LineTerminator as defined at the eleventh edition of the 
EMCAScript Language Specification. The 37 hyphen-minuses are in-a-row.

"in-a-row", where it refers to a group of hyphen-minuses, means that:
  1. Immediately preceding the hyphen-minuses is a newline.
  2. Immediately following the hyphen-minuses is a newline.
  3. Between the first and last hyphen-minus of the group,
     there can only be other hyphen-minuses.

The 74 hyphen-minuses in-a-row do not include 37 hyphen-minuses in-a-row.


"Other Licenses" are the licenses from the sites in the 
following list:
  1. https://github.com/icecream17/tic-tac-toe-grow-for-website/blob/main/LICENSE


The following clarifications apply:
  1. the Software referenced in this license means the same thing as the
     "Larger Software" referenced in the Other Licenses.
  2. the Software referenced in this license is not the same thing as any
     Other Software referenced in any Other Licenses, (rather, as mentioned
     in the Other Licenses, the Other Software is part of the Software)

-------------------------------------

All the Other Licenses are assumed to have the text following the 74
hyphen-minuses in-a-row. If one or more of the Other Licenses do not,
then this license overrides those Other Licenses, and those Other Licenses
are assumed to have the text following the 74 hyphen-minuses in-a-row.
The text following the 74 hyphen-minuses in-a-row are seperate from this
license.
