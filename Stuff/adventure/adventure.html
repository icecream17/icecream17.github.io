            <p>
               I've tried to make everything tabbable.<br>
               Note that the menu has a 1 second delay.
            </p>
            <p>
               Well actually the menu updates every 77 milliseconds.<br>
               I set it so that the menu waits 13 updates until it closes.<br>
               That just happens to be 1.001 seconds, but you can change it here:<br>(Not done yet)

            <summary>Colors</summary>
            <p>
               Currently contrast is high. You can change the colors here:
               <br>(Not done yet) (For soft-contrast people, also others that are colorblind or something.)

         <p>
            Please, if you have Internet Explorer, choose a different browser!
            <br><i class = "dogeblue">
               You are causing developers worldwide to suffer
            <br></i>
            <i class = "red">No, seriously.</i><br><br>
            <strong>Internet Explorer is definitely unsupported</strong><br><br>
            On another note, it definitely works on Chrome, but i'm not
            sure about any other browsers.<br>
            I've also seen how squished and horrible it looks on mobile devices.
            <br>So for now I recommend using a non-mobile device.
            <br><br>
            "Android Browser" and "Firefox for Android" users,<br>
            Those browsers don't support "CSS property: cursor: help",
            which means that when you hover over "Instructions" in the menu,<br>
            a question mark won't appear next to your cursor.<br><br>
            Also, "Opera Mini", "QQ Browser", and "Baidu Browser" don't support
            "CSS Variables (Custom Properties)".<br>
            So when you try to change something in Settings, it won't work
            if it has to do with appearance. Like, colors. <br>
            (Presumably, I haven't actually finished making the Settings.)
            <br><br>
            Looking at the stats from caniuse.com, about 50% of you
            are fully up to date with your browsers.<br> Please check
            <a href = "https://www.whatismybrowser.com/">whatismybrowser.com</a>
            to see if you need to update. Highly recommended!<br><br>
