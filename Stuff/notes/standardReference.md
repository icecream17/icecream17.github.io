# Standards

Some standardization for stuff

## For a joke involving pronounciation

Use the IPA or create your own sound system.

Your own sound system has to be surrounded in forward slashes.

"I wish... to build a robot to fly, with wings"

"So it has /aɪ/"

"Yes /aɪ/. You mean like two eye, four eyes, six eyes...?"
